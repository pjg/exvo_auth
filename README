-1. Get familiar with OmniAuth by Intridea: http://github.com/intridea/omniauth. Read about OAuth2.


0. Obtain client_id and client_secret for your app from Exvo.


1. Install exvo-auth gem or add it to your Gemfile.


2. Configure middleware(s).

There are two middlewares. Usually you will need the "interactive" one:

  ExvoAuth::Strategies::Interactive
  ExvoAuth::Strategies::NonInteractive
  
Both middlewares need client_id and client_secret arguments.
In Rails, the relevant line could look like this:

  config.middleware.use ExvoAuth::Strategies::Interactive, "client_id", "client_secret"

    
3. Add routes.

The following comes from Rails config/routes.rb file:

  match "/auth/failure"                  => "sessions#failure"
  match "/auth/interactive/callback"     => "sessions#create"
  match "/auth/non_interactive/callback" => "sessions#create"

Failure url is called whenever there's a failure (d'oh).
You can have separate callbacks for interactive and non-interactive
callback routes but you can also route both callbacks to the same controller method
like shown above.


4. Implement callback(s).

Sample implementation in SessionsController:

  def create
    render :text => params[:auth].inspect
  end
  
In short: you get params[:auth]. Do what you want to do with it: store the data, create session, etc.


5. Read the source, there are few features not mentioned in this README.
