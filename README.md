# exvo_auth

This gem supplements the [omniauth-exvo](https://github.com/Exvo/omniauth-exvo/) gem. Together they implement the oauth2 protocol for handling users and applications authentication at Exvo.

This gem depends on the [exvo_helpers](https://github.com/Exvo/exvo_helpers) gem for all of its configuration.


Note, that this gem was previously named "exvo-auth".



## Requirements

* Runs on Ruby 1.8.7 & 1.9.2 (preferred version)
* Rails 3.0+ (works with Rails 3.1) or Merb



## Installation

Add it to Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "exvo_auth"
```

Run bundle:

```bash
$ bundle
```

The preferred way to configure this gem is via the ENV variables:

```ruby
ENV['AUTH_CLIENT_ID']     = "foo"
ENV['AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET'] = "bar"
ENV['AUTH_DEBUG']         = "true"          # [OPTIONAL] dumps all HTTP traffic to STDERR, useful during development; it *has to be a string, not a boolean*
ENV['AUTH_REQUIRE_SSL']   = "false"         # [OPTIONAL] disable SSL, useful in development (note that all apps API urls must be http, not https); it *has to be a string, not a boolean*
ENV['AUTH_HOST']          = "test.exvo.com" # [OPTIONAL] override the default auth host
ENV['SSO_COOKIE_SECRET']  = "secret"        # Generate using `SecureRandom.hex(16)`
```

But you can also set things directly in the `config/application.rb` file (before the middleware declaration):

```ruby
Exvo::Helpers.auth_client_id     = "foo"
Exvo::Helpers.auth_client_secret = "bar"
Exvo::Helpers.auth_debug         = true            # boolean
Exvo::Helpers.auth_require_ssl   = false           # boolean
Exvo::Helpers.auth_host          = "test.exvo.com"
Exvo::Helpers.sso_cookie_secret  = "secret"
```


Add routes (Rails example):

```ruby
match "/auth/exvo/callback" => "sessions#create"
match "/auth/failure"       => "sessions#failure"
match "/sign_out"           => "sessions#destroy"
```

Include controller helpers in your `ApplicationController.rb`:

```ruby
include ExvoAuth::Controllers::Rails # (or Merb)
```

Implement a sessions controller (Rails example):

```ruby
class SessionsController < ApplicationController
  def create
    sign_in_and_redirect!
  end

  def destroy
    sign_out_and_redirect!
  end

  def failure
    render :text => "Sorry!"
  end
end
```

It's good to have your `SessionsController`'s `#create` action a little more extended, so that each time the user logs in into the app, his user data (like email, nickname, etc.) is updated from the auth app (i.e. from his profile):

```ruby
def create
  auth_hash = request.env["omniauth.auth"]
  user = User.find_or_create_by_uid(auth_hash["uid"])

  if user && user.update_from_auth_hash(auth_hash)
    sign_in_and_redirect!
  else
    fail "Could not update user"
  end
end
```

and your `#update_from_auth_hash` method at `User` model might look like this:

```ruby
def update_from_auth_hash(auth_hash)
  update_attributes({
    :nickname => auth_hash["info"]["nickname"],
    :email => auth_hash["info"]["email"],
    :plan => auth_hash["extra"]["raw_info"]["plan"],
    :language => auth_hash["extra"]["raw_info"]["language"]
  })
end
```

Note, that you don't have to update all user attributes. You can update only the ones you want.


This is what you get (and what you can use/save for the local user) from auth (example data as of 2012-01):

```ruby
request.env["omniauth.auth"].to_hash.inspect

  {
    "provider" => "exvo",
    "uid" => 1,

    "credentials" => {
      "token" => "a2d09701559b9f26a8284d6f94670477d882ad6d9f3d92ce9917262a6b54085fa3fb99e111340459",
      "expires" => false
    },

    "info" => {
      "nickname" => "Pawel",
      "email" => "pawel@exvo.com",
      "name" => "Pawel"
    },

    "extra" => {
      "raw_info" => {
        "id" => 1,
        "nickname" => "Pawel",
        "country_code" => nil,
        "plan" => "basic",
        "language" => "en",
        "email" => "pawel@exvo.com",
        "referring_user_id" => nil
      }
    }
  }
```


Implement `#find_or_create_user_by_uid(uid)` in your `ApplicationController`:

This method will be called by `#current_user`. Previously we did this in `sessions_controller` but since the sharing sessions changes this controller will not be used in most cases because the session comes from another app through a shared cookie. This method should find user by uid or create it.

Exemplary implementation (Rails):

```ruby
def find_or_create_user_by_uid(uid)
  User.find_or_create_by_uid(uid)
end
```

It's best to leave this method as it is (without updating any user data inside this method, better to do this in the SessionsController#create action). Updating user in this method might lead to some very hard to debug cyclic executions possibly leading to stack-level too deep errors and/or general slowness, so please proceed with extreme caution.


## Sign up and sign in paths for use in links

```ruby
sign in path:                       "/auth/exvo"
sign up path:                       "/auth/exvo?x_sign_up=true" # this is OAuth2 custom param
sign in path with a return address: "/auth/exvo?state=url"      # using OAuth2 state param
```

You have a handy methods available in controllers (and views in Rails): `sign_in_path` and `sign_up_path`.


## Require authentication in your controllers

If you want to protect your controllers from unauthorized access, you can add in your `ApplicationController` (for all controllers) or in some controller:

```ruby
before_filter :authenticate_user!
```

If your application requires being accessed by a not logged in users, but you would still like to display a "logged in" state for users, which are logged in, you can unobtrusively authenticate such users by adding this in your controller(s):

```ruby
before_filter :unobtrusively_authenticate_user!
```


## Signle Sign On

All Exvo applications use the Single Sign On mechanism with a shared cookie visible to all apps using the exvo.com domain. This is a signed cookie (HMAC), that cannot be tampered with.

After signing in or signin up Exvo Auth, this cookie is set and from this moment each application will authenticate the user based only on this cookie. Signing out will delete this cookie.


## Fetching user information

All info about any particular user can be obtained using auth api (`/users/uid.json` path).


## Inter-Application Communication

You need to have "App Authorization" created by Exvo first.

Contact us and provide following details:

* `consumer_id` - Id of an app that will be a consumer (this is you)
* `provider_id` - Id of the provider app
* `scope`       - The tag associated with the api you want to use in the provider app


### Consumer side

```ruby
consumer = ExvoAuth::Autonomous::Consumer.new(
  :app_id => "this is client_id of the app you want to connect to"
)
consumer.get(*args) # interface is exactly the same like in HTTParty. All http methods are available (post, put, delete, head, options).
```


### Provider side

See `#authenticate_app_in_scope!(scope)` method in `ExvoAuth::Controllers::Rails` (or Merb). This method lets you create a before filter.
Scopes are used by providing app to check if a given consuming app should have access to a given resource inside a scope.
If scopes are empty, then provider app should not present any resources to consumer.


Example of the before filter for provider controller:

```ruby
before_filter { |c| c.authenticate_app_in_scope!("payments") }
```

In the provider controller, which is just a fancy name for API controller, you can use `#current_app_id` method to get the `app_id` of the app connecting.
